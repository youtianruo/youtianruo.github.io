## Research Experiences

### Hairy Ball Theorem and Degree Theory Exploration
**Research Student under Galen Liang** | Berkeley, CA | Aug. 2025 - Present

- Applied degree theory to vector fields on spheres, using the pathway toward the Hairy Ball Theorem to strengthen understanding of algebraic topology methods, invariants such as the degree of a map, and the role of topological obstructions
- Co-authoring a thesis on degree theory as an entry point into topology, emphasizing its utility in defining map degree, connecting manifold invariants, and framing classical results like the Hairy Ball Theorem

### Paul Atzberger Research Group
**Research Student under Paul Atzberger** | Santa Barbara, CA | Nov. 2023 - Jun. 2024

- Simulated cryptocurrency price triangulation using stochastic processes to model arbitrage opportunities, providing a quantitative explanation of the "kimchi premium"
- Applied a stochastic immersed boundary method to simulate fluidstructure interactions at microscopic length scales, advancing computational modeling of complex physical systems

### NSF Big-Bee Project: Trait Digitalization of Anthophila
**Researcher** | Santa Barbara / Berkeley, CA | Aug. 2023 - Present

- Developed a computer vision pipeline (OpenCV, scikit-learn, Python) to quantify disruptive camouflage in bees by detecting and clustering visual hotspots
- Implemented a volumetric measurement pipeline with Agisoft Metashape to model and compare size variation in Bombus species through 3D reconstruction and computational morphometrics
- Processed high-resolution imaging sets with ImageJ and Zerene Stacker to generate ultra-resolution photos, contributing finalized images to the NSF Big-Bee library, with one exhibited at the UCSB Main Library and the California Nature Art Museum

## Professional Experiences

### Syriac Text Digitalization and Database Development
**Data Science Assistant under David A. Michelson** | Nashville, TN | Aug. 2024 - May. 2025

- Repaired discrepancies in the Syriaca.org database by tracing entries back to original Syriac sources and applying targeted HTML edits, supporting the accurate digitalization of Syriac Christian manuscripts
- Improved the accuracy and stability of the Syriac Reference Portal, enabling scholars to more reliably search, cross-reference, and analyze Syriac Christian texts
