## In Preparation

### Degree Theory as an Entry Point into Topology
**Authors**: Tianruo You, Galen Liang  
**Status**: In preparation  
**Abstract**: This work explores degree theory as a fundamental tool for understanding topological invariants, with particular emphasis on its application to vector fields on spheres and the Hairy Ball Theorem. We demonstrate how degree theory provides a natural entry point into algebraic topology and connects various classical results in topology and differential geometry.
