# Research

My research interests span across pure and applied mathematics, with a particular focus on topology, differential geometry, and computational methods. Below are the main research projects I am currently involved in:

## Current Research Projects

### Hairy Ball Theorem and Degree Theory Exploration
**Advisor**: Galen Liang | **Institution**: UC Berkeley | **Duration**: Aug. 2025 - Present

This research project explores the fundamental connections between degree theory and vector fields on manifolds, particularly focusing on the famous Hairy Ball Theorem. The Hairy Ball Theorem states that there is no non-vanishing continuous tangent vector field on even-dimensional n-spheres, which has profound implications in topology and differential geometry.

**Key Contributions:**
- Applied degree theory to vector fields on spheres, strengthening understanding of algebraic topology methods
- Investigated invariants such as the degree of a map and their role in topological obstructions
- Co-authoring a thesis on degree theory as an entry point into topology

**Mathematical Background:**
The degree of a continuous map between compact oriented manifolds of the same dimension is a fundamental invariant that counts the number of times the map "wraps around" the target manifold. This concept is crucial for understanding the Hairy Ball Theorem and similar topological results.

### NSF Big-Bee Project: Trait Digitalization of Anthophila
**Institution**: UC Santa Barbara / UC Berkeley | **Duration**: Aug. 2023 - Present

This interdisciplinary project combines computer vision, computational geometry, and biological research to study bee morphology and behavior patterns.

**Key Contributions:**
- Developed computer vision pipeline using OpenCV and scikit-learn to quantify disruptive camouflage in bees
- Implemented volumetric measurement pipeline with Agisoft Metashape for 3D reconstruction
- Processed high-resolution imaging sets with ImageJ and Zerene Stacker
- Contributed finalized images to NSF Big-Bee library, with exhibitions at UCSB Main Library and California Nature Art Museum

**Technical Approach:**
The project uses advanced image processing techniques to detect and cluster visual hotspots in bee imagery, enabling quantitative analysis of camouflage patterns. The 3D reconstruction pipeline allows for precise morphometric measurements of Bombus species.

## Past Research

### Cryptocurrency Price Modeling and Stochastic Processes
**Advisor**: Paul Atzberger | **Institution**: UC Santa Barbara | **Duration**: Nov. 2023 - Jun. 2024

This project applied stochastic differential equations to model cryptocurrency price dynamics and arbitrage opportunities.

**Key Contributions:**
- Simulated cryptocurrency price triangulation using stochastic processes
- Modeled arbitrage opportunities, providing quantitative explanation of the "kimchi premium"
- Applied stochastic immersed boundary method to simulate fluid-structure interactions

**Mathematical Framework:**
The research utilized stochastic differential equations to model price dynamics, incorporating market microstructure effects and cross-exchange arbitrage opportunities.
