# Teaching

## Teaching Philosophy

Mathematics is not just a collection of abstract concepts, but a powerful language for understanding the world around us. My teaching philosophy centers on making mathematics accessible, engaging, and relevant to students' lives. I believe in:

- **Active Learning**: Encouraging students to discover mathematical concepts through guided exploration and problem-solving
- **Real-World Applications**: Connecting abstract mathematical ideas to concrete applications in science, technology, and everyday life
- **Collaborative Learning**: Fostering an environment where students learn from each other through group work and peer instruction
- **Clear Communication**: Presenting complex mathematical ideas in clear, understandable terms while maintaining mathematical rigor
