# Welcome to My Academic Website

I am **Tianruo You**, a mathematics student at UC Berkeley with a passion for topology, differential geometry, and computational mathematics. Currently pursuing my Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics with a perfect 4.00 GPA, I am deeply engaged in research that bridges pure mathematics with practical applications.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on several interconnected areas:

- **Algebraic Topology**: Exploring degree theory and its applications to vector fields on manifolds
- **Differential Geometry**: Investigating geometric structures and their topological properties  
- **Computational Mathematics**: Developing algorithms for mathematical modeling and simulation
- **Mathematical Biology**: Applying mathematical methods to biological systems

## Current Research

I am currently working on the **Hairy Ball Theorem and Degree Theory** under the guidance of Galen Liang at UC Berkeley. This research explores how degree theory can be used to understand vector fields on spheres and provides insights into topological obstructions in mathematical systems.

## Education

- **UC Berkeley** (Aug. 2025 - Jun. 2026, Expected) - Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics, GPA: 4.00
