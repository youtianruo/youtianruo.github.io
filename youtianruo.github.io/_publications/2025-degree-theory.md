## Abstract

This work explores degree theory as a fundamental tool for understanding topological invariants, with particular emphasis on its application to vector fields on spheres and the Hairy Ball Theorem. We demonstrate how degree theory provides a natural entry point into algebraic topology and connects various classical results in topology and differential geometry.

## Key Contributions

- Applied degree theory to vector fields on spheres, strengthening understanding of algebraic topology methods
- Investigated invariants such as the degree of a map and their role in topological obstructions
- Co-authored a thesis on degree theory as an entry point into topology

## Mathematical Background

The degree of a continuous map between compact oriented manifolds of the same dimension is a fundamental invariant that counts the number of times the map "wraps around" the target manifold. This concept is crucial for understanding the Hairy Ball Theorem and similar topological results.

## Research Impact

This work contributes to the understanding of topological obstructions in mathematical systems and provides insights into the connections between algebraic topology and differential geometry.
