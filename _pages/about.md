## Academic Background

I am a dedicated mathematics student with a perfect 4.00 GPA across multiple prestigious institutions. My academic journey has taken me through UC Santa Barbara, Vanderbilt University, and now UC Berkeley, where I am pursuing my final year of undergraduate studies in mathematics.

Throughout my academic career, I have maintained a strong focus on both theoretical and applied mathematics, with particular emphasis on topology, differential geometry, and computational methods. My coursework has included advanced topics in linear algebra, abstract algebra, real analysis, and differential geometry, providing me with a solid foundation for research in these areas.

## Professional Development

In addition to my academic studies, I have gained valuable experience through various research projects and professional opportunities. These experiences have allowed me to apply mathematical concepts to real-world problems, from modeling cryptocurrency markets to developing computer vision pipelines for biological research.

My work has contributed to several ongoing research projects, including the NSF Big-Bee Project and various computational mathematics initiatives. I have also contributed to digital humanities projects, specifically in the area of Syriac text digitalization and database development.
