## Publications

*Coming soon!* I am currently working on several research projects that will result in publications. Please check back later for updates.

## In Preparation

### Degree Theory as an Entry Point into Topology
**Co-authored with Galen Liang**  
*In preparation*

A comprehensive exploration of degree theory and its applications to classical results in topology, with particular emphasis on the Hairy Ball Theorem and its implications for understanding topological obstructions.

### Computational Morphometrics of Bombus Species
**NSF Big-Bee Project**  
*In preparation*

A study of size variation in Bombus species using 3D reconstruction and computational morphometrics, contributing to the understanding of bee evolution and ecology.

## Conference Presentations

*Presentations will be listed here as they are completed.*

## Research Reports

### Cryptocurrency Price Triangulation Using Stochastic Processes
**Paul Atzberger Research Group**  
UC Santa Barbara, 2024

A quantitative analysis of arbitrage opportunities in cryptocurrency markets, with particular focus on the "kimchi premium" phenomenon.

### Fluid-Structure Interactions at Microscopic Length Scales
**Paul Atzberger Research Group**  
UC Santa Barbara, 2024

Development and application of stochastic immersed boundary methods for simulating complex physical systems.

## Software and Tools

### Computer Vision Pipeline for Bee Trait Analysis
**NSF Big-Bee Project**  
*Available upon request*

A Python-based pipeline for quantifying disruptive camouflage in bees using OpenCV and scikit-learn.

### Volumetric Measurement Pipeline
**NSF Big-Bee Project**  
*Available upon request*

A workflow for 3D reconstruction and morphometric analysis using Agisoft Metashape.

## Research Contributions

### Digital Humanities
- **Syriac Text Digitalization**: Contributed to the accuracy and stability of the Syriac Reference Portal through database maintenance and HTML editing
- **NSF Big-Bee Library**: Contributed high-resolution images to the national bee image library, with one image exhibited at the UCSB Main Library and California Nature Art Museum

## Future Publications

I am actively working on several research projects that will result in publications in the coming months:

1. **Topological Methods in Computational Biology**: Exploring applications of degree theory to biological systems
2. **Stochastic Modeling of Complex Systems**: Developing new methods for modeling fluid-structure interactions
3. **Digital Morphometrics**: Advancing computational methods for biological shape analysis
4. **Mathematical Foundations of Cryptocurrency Markets**: Theoretical analysis of market dynamics and arbitrage opportunities
