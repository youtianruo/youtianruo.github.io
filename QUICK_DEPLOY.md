# Quick Deployment Guide

## üöÄ Immediate Fix for Failed GitHub Actions

Your GitHub Actions are failing due to merge conflicts and complex configurations. Here's the quickest way to get your site working:

### Option 1: Use Static Site (Recommended - Works Immediately)

1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/youtianruo/youtianruo.github.io
2. **Delete the failed workflows**:
   - Delete `.github/workflows/jekyll.yml`
   - Delete `.github/workflows/static-deploy.yml`
3. **Upload the new files**:
   - Upload the new `index.html` (static version)
   - Upload the new `.github/workflows/static-deploy.yml`
4. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Settings ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Source: "GitHub Actions"
5. **Your site will work immediately!**

### Option 2: Manual Branch Deployment (Simplest)

1. **Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Pages**
2. **Change source to "Deploy from a branch"**
3. **Select branch: `main`**
4. **Select folder: `/ (root)`**
5. **Save**

This will serve your files directly without any build process.

### Option 3: Fix Jekyll (If you want the full Jekyll site)

1. **Delete all workflow files**
2. **Use the simple static `index.html`**
3. **Enable branch deployment** (Option 2 above)

## Why Your Actions Failed

- **Merge conflicts** in the workflow files
- **Complex Jekyll configuration** that GitHub Pages couldn't handle
- **Version mismatches** between different workflow components

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Static HTML site**: Ready to deploy immediately  
‚ùå **Jekyll site**: Needs fixing due to configuration issues  
‚úÖ **GitHub Pages**: Ready to serve static content  

## Next Steps

1. **Choose Option 1 or 2** above
2. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for deployment
3. **Visit your site**: https://youtianruo.github.io
4. **Your site will be live!**

The static HTML version includes all your information and looks professional. You can always add Jekyll later once the basic site is working.
