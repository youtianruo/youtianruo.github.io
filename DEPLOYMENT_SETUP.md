# Jekyll Site Deployment Setup Guide

## Problem Solved
The github-pages gem dependency issue has been resolved by:
1. ✅ Fixed merge conflicts in `Gemfile` and `_config.yml`
2. ✅ Created a GitHub Actions workflow that builds Jekyll 4.3.0 without github-pages gem
3. ✅ Set up proper dependency management

## Quick Setup (Recommended)

### Option 1: Use GitHub Actions (No Local Setup Required)
1. **Commit and push your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Jekyll dependencies and setup GitHub Actions"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Navigate to "Pages" section
   - Set source to "GitHub Actions"
   - The workflow will automatically build and deploy your site

### Option 2: Local Development Setup

#### Install Ruby and Bundler (Windows)
1. **Install Ruby using RubyInstaller:**
   - Download from: https://rubyinstaller.org/
   - Choose Ruby+Devkit version
   - Run the installer and follow instructions

2. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   ruby --version
   gem --version
   ```

3. **Install Bundler:**
   ```bash
   gem install bundler
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

5. **Build and serve locally:**
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```
   Or use the provided script:
   ```bash
   build-local.bat
   ```

## Files Modified/Created

### Fixed Files:
- `Gemfile` - Removed merge conflicts, using Jekyll 4.3.0
- `_config.yml` - Removed merge conflicts, clean configuration

### New Files:
- `.github/workflows/jekyll-build.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow for building and deploying
- `build-local.bat` - Windows script for local development
- `DEPLOYMENT_SETUP.md` - This guide

## How It Works

The new GitHub Actions workflow:
1. **Builds your site** using Jekyll 4.3.0 (not github-pages gem)
2. **Deploys automatically** when you push to main branch
3. **Avoids dependency conflicts** by using the latest Jekyll version
4. **Works with your existing plugins** (jekyll-feed, jekyll-sitemap, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

### If GitHub Actions fails:
1. Check the Actions tab in your repository
2. Look for error messages in the build logs
3. Ensure your `_config.yml` is valid YAML

### If local build fails:
1. Make sure Ruby and Bundler are installed
2. Run `bundle install` to install dependencies
3. Check for any syntax errors in your files

## Next Steps

1. **Push your changes** to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow
2. **Check your site** at `https://youtianruo.github.io` (may take a few minutes)
3. **Make updates** by editing files and pushing to main branch

Your Jekyll site should now build and deploy successfully without the github-pages gem dependency issues!
