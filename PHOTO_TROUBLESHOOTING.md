- Case sensitive

#### Check 3: Check File Size
- Should be under 1MB

## üöÄ Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Re-upload with Correct Name
1. Go to `assets/images/` folder
2. Delete any existing photo files
3. Upload your photo as `bio-photo.jpg`
4. Commit changes
5. Wait 10 minutes

### Fix 2: Use Different Filename
If `bio-photo.jpg` doesn't work, try:
1. Upload as `profile.jpg`
2. Update `_config.yml`:
   ```yaml
   author:
     avatar: "/assets/images/profile.jpg"
   ```

### Fix 3: Direct URL Test
Test if your photo is accessible:
- Go to: `https://youtianruo.github.io/assets/images/bio-photo.jpg`
- If you see your photo, the file is working
- If you get 404, the file isn't uploaded correctly

### Fix 4: Use Base64 Encoding (Advanced)
If file upload continues to fail, you can embed the image directly in HTML.
