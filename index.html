Welcome to my academic website! I am Tianruo You, a mathematics student at UC Berkeley with research interests in topology, differential geometry, and computational mathematics.

## About Me

I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics at UC Berkeley, where I maintain a perfect 4.00 GPA. My academic journey has taken me through multiple prestigious institutions, including Vanderbilt University and UC Santa Barbara, where I also achieved perfect GPAs in mathematics programs.

My research focuses on exploring fundamental concepts in topology and differential geometry, particularly through the lens of degree theory and its applications to classical results like the Hairy Ball Theorem.

## Research Interests

- **Topology**: Degree theory, algebraic topology methods, and topological obstructions
- **Differential Geometry**: Vector fields on manifolds and geometric structures
- **Computational Mathematics**: Stochastic processes, fluid-structure interactions, and computer vision applications
- **Applied Mathematics**: Cryptocurrency modeling, computational morphometrics, and digital humanities

## Current Research

I am currently working on several exciting projects:

1. **Hairy Ball Theorem and Degree Theory Exploration** - Research under Galen Liang at UC Berkeley
2. **NSF Big-Bee Project** - Developing computer vision pipelines for bee trait digitalization
3. **Syriac Text Digitalization** - Contributing to database development and accuracy improvements
