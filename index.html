  <div class="post-content">
    <p>I am Tianruo You, a mathematics student at UC Berkeley with research interests in topology, differential geometry, and computational mathematics.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics at UC Berkeley, where I maintain a perfect 4.00 GPA. My academic journey has taken me through multiple prestigious institutions, including Vanderbilt University and UC Santa Barbara, where I also achieved perfect GPAs in mathematics programs.</p>

    <p>My research focuses on exploring fundamental concepts in topology and differential geometry, particularly through the lens of degree theory and its applications to classical results like the Hairy Ball Theorem.</p>

    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Topology</strong>: Degree theory, algebraic topology methods, and topological obstructions</li>
      <li><strong>Differential Geometry</strong>: Vector fields on manifolds and geometric structures</li>
      <li><strong>Computational Mathematics</strong>: Stochastic processes, fluid-structure interactions, and computer vision applications</li>
      <li><strong>Applied Mathematics</strong>: Cryptocurrency modeling, computational morphometrics, and digital humanities</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Current Research</h2>
    <p>I am currently working on several exciting projects:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Hairy Ball Theorem and Degree Theory Exploration</strong> - Research under Galen Liang at UC Berkeley</li>
      <li><strong>NSF Big-Bee Project</strong> - Developing computer vision pipelines for bee trait digitalization</li>
      <li><strong>Syriac Text Digitalization</strong> - Contributing to database development and accuracy improvements</li>
    </ol>
